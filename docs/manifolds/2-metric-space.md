# 1.2 Metric Space
:::note Deinition of Metric Space
A metric space is a set $A$ with a distance function $d(X,Y)|X,Y \in A$ that satisfies following axioms:
- Symmetry: $d(X,Y) = d(Y,X)$
- Positive definite: $d(X,Y) \geq 0$, and $d(X,Y) = 0 \iff X=Y$.
- Triangle inequality: $d(X,Z) \leq d(X,Y) + d(Y,Z)$
:::

Do the above axioms look famaliar to you? Those are the same thing as the **euclidean distance properties** we introduced in the previous chapter. In other words, **all euclidean spaces are metric spaces** by definition.
